Open-sourcing my genome

A couple years ago I took part in a study that involved sequencing the genomes of people (to look for certain markers). In return for sending them a bit of spit, they returned to me a big bucket of data representing my genome. 

Cool.

I never actually did anything with it, though. There don't exactly seem to be a whole lot of tools - online or downloadable - that can inhale these data sets and give me some kind of cool information about my ancestors or medical risks or such. 

Dunno.

Since I'm an open-source kind of guy, I'm thus hereby relaxing copyright on my genetic code and am offering it under the terms of CC: by-nc-sa (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) to the public at large. Go ahead and get creative with this...

;)

[The file was too large for upload, so I split it into two parts. Jut put them back together into one in a text-editor or such...]
